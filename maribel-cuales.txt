    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
        Semantic HTML means that all of the markups should relay the meaning of your content. (e.g <header> means the header/heading of a webpage, etc.) 

    2. What is HTML used for? 
        It stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it?
        HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
        It is the first header tag visible on a page. It is used for the title of a page or post. One h1 tag is sufficient already for a 
        webpage. Multiple h1s can be used as long as they are not being overused to the point of spamming, and the h1s fit contextually 
        within the structure of the page.

        a. <img> tag that requires the src attribute.
        b. <a> tag that requires the href attribute.  

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
        When writing in HTML, the <head> tag is used to contain specific information about a web page, often referred to as metadata.

        The <section> tag defines an area of a document that can be a part or sector like Header Section, Footer Section, etc.
        <Div> elements have no meaning in and of themselves and generally are only used for styling purposes.

        Use an id if one element should be unique from the other elements. Use class if you need to apply the same attributes to more than one 
        element. This way, one's code is more efficient.  

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
        To select classes in CSS, place a . before the class name then {}. Place the attributes inside the {}. (e.g .sample-class {})

    34. Why should I use version control?
